                    <p>
                        Mahendra Singh Dhoni was born in Ranchi, Bihar (now in Jharkhand) to Pan Singh and Devaki Devi. His ancestral village is Lwali, in the Lamgara block of Almora District, Uttarakhand.

                        Despite his interest in sports, Dhoni initially worked as a Train Ticket Examiner (TTE) at Kharagpur railway station from 2001 to 2003, a period he often describes as challenging but formative. His passion for cricket, however, never waned, leading him to pursue the sport professionally.
